 * An info source is a website which contains generic series information and

 * an individual ContentSource.

 * Currently, instances of this class are not heavily utilized, since most
 * ContentSource's provide adequate series information. In the future, we may
 * want to utilize instances of this class to "fill in" for missing data
 * from ContentSource's.
 * <p>
 * The client maintains only one InfoSource at a time, which is hardcoded in
 * {@link PluginManager}. In the future, we may allow the user to switch the
 * current InfoSource in their settings.
