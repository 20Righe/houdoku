# Download

Download Houdoku from [the releases page](https://github.com/xgi/houdoku/releases).

For Windows users, a native .exe is provided. Users on other operating systems should download the
.jar. Both options require a sufficient Java installation with JRE version 8 or later.

The client can typically be run by simply double clicking the file. Alternatively, you may start
the client via the command line:

```bash
$ java -jar houdoku-x.y.z.jar
```

# Plugins

Support for 3rd party content sources (manga aggregators) is available via a plugin interface. You
may install and update plugins by going to File->Settings->Plugins in the client.

For more information, and for an index of available plugins, see the
[houdoku-plugins repository](https://github.com/xgi/houdoku-plugins).

# Dependencies

Running Houdoku requires Java (JRE) 8 or later.

The project makes use of the following 3rd-party libraries, which are bundled with the application:

* JSoup 1.11.3 -- Parse HTML documents
* OkHttp3 3.10.0 -- Make HTTP requests
* Gson 2.8.4 -- Object serialization
* AppDirs 1.0.1 -- Determine OS-specific data directories
* slf4j-simple (SimpleLogger) 1.7.25 -- Logging
* JUnit 4.12 -- Unit testing
* Mockito 2.19.1 -- Mocks for unit testing

Libraries are downloaded from the Maven Central Repository -- see this project's [pom.xml](https://github.com/xgi/houdoku/blob/master/pom.xml).

# Testing

This project uses Maven for building and testing. Running unit tests is easy:

```bash
$ mvn test
```

To compile the executable JAR, use `mvn package`. The Houdoku artifact will be in
`./out/artifacts`. This command may be useful for building & running the client (note the
optional `skipTests`):

```bash
$ mvn package [-DskipTests] && \
    java -jar ./out/artifacts/houdoku/Houdoku-*.jar
```

## Connecting to external clients

Developers who want to test support for some 3rd-party services, such as the AniList API, will need
to register external clients. Houdoku can run without enabling these services, but functionality
may be limited.

Credentials are stored in a properties file. See the
[secret.properties template](https://github.com/xgi/houdoku/blob/master/src/main/resources/secret.properties.template) for instructions on
creating credentials for each external client.
