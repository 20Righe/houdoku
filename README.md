## Stack

**Application**: This is an Electron application. The majority of the functionality is performed in the renderer thread. Exceptions are for cases like accessing the window class (i.e. to support minimizing the window), locating application directories, and for working with extensions. The renderer can invoke these functions through ipc.

**UI**: The interface uses React components. Most base components (text, buttons, links, etc.) come from [Mantine](https://mantine.dev/).

**State**: [Recoil](https://recoiljs.org) is used for state management. Hooks are used for small
non-shared behavior.

**Storage**: Library data and settings are saved with `localStorage`. Thumbnails are stored in
the user-data path.

**Plugins/Extensions**: See the [houdoku-extensions](https://github.com/xgi/houdoku-extensions) repo. Dynamic loading is handled by [aki-plugin-manager](https://github.com/xgi/aki-plugin-manager).

## Extensions

Houdoku does not host any material; it retrieves media from public websites
("content sources"). Support for content sources is provided through
various extensions which can be installed/updated from the Extensions tab
within the client. Houdoku is not affiliated with any content source.

There are no "recommended extensions", but you should feel free to
try several and mix-and-match according to which ones work well for you.

If you would like to request support for a website or report an issue with
an existing extension, please go to the
[houdoku-extensions](https://github.com/xgi/houdoku-extensions) repo.
