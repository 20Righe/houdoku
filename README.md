# Download

~~Download Houdoku from [the releases page](https://github.com/xgi/houdoku/releases).~~

Coming soon! Run the development version for now.

# Development

Install dependencies:

```
yarn
```

Start the app in the dev environment:

```
yarn start
```

# Plugins

Houdoku uses 3rd-party content sources to provide access to manga.
Currently, these are embedded in the client (one for MangaDex, and
one for local imports). In the future, these will likely be separated
into their own repository and updated from within Houdoku.

# History

Houdoku used to be a JavaFX application, but has been rebuilt in
Electron (starting with v2.0.0). The JavaFX version is not supported.
