## Reporting Issues & Requesting Features

### Reporting Issues/Bugs

1. Check whether the issue has already been reported by using the search feature
on the project's [Issues page](https://github.com/xgi/houdoku/issues). If you
think that the existing report is missing important information, feel free to
add to it -- but don't just say "same"!
2. If you couldn't find an existing Issue,
[create your own](https://github.com/xgi/houdoku/issues/new).
3. Fill out as much information about your issue as possible, including:
    * A brief description of the issue.
    * A list of steps to reproduce the issue.
    * The expected behavior.
    * The version (or git commit) of the client you are using.
    * Your operating system.

### Requesting Features

1. Check whether the feature has already been requested by using the search
feature on the project's [Issues page](https://github.com/xgi/houdoku/issues).
If you think that the existing report is missing important information, feel
free to add to it -- but don't just say "same"!
2. If you couldn't find an existing Issue,
[create your own](https://github.com/xgi/houdoku/issues/new).
3. Fill out as much information about your request as possible, including:
    * A brief description of the feature.
    * Why you believe the feature should be added.

## Contributing Code

1. **Even if you intend to work on a feature or fix a bug by yourself,
[create an issue](#reporting-issues-&-requesting-features) before submitting a
pull request.** Your pull request should include a reference to the Issue which
your code resolves. This helps to avoid multiple users unknowingly working on
the same project, allows other developers to give feedback before you start,
and also leaves a "paper trail" of the motive behind the request.
2. Create a pull request with your changes. Make sure to include:
    * A brief description of the changes.
    * A reference to the Issue which your changes resolve.
